 What I Used and Did:
 
1. PivotTables and Charts

Created multiple PivotTables to summarize:
- Sales by Region
- Sales by Category
- Top 5 Products by Sales
- Used these PivotTables to build visual charts:
- Bar charts and Pie charts
- Sales data is filtered dynamically with slicers

2. KPI Summary Section

Calculated key business indicators like:
- Total Sales, Total Profit
- Total Orders, Average Order Value
- Used Excel formulas (SUM, COUNTA, etc.) to generate real-time metrics

3. Slicers and Interactivity

- Inserted Slicers for Region and Category
- Connected slicers to multiple PivotTables using Report Connections
- Enabled easy filtering of charts and data views

4. Lookup Functions

- Created a reference table for product-level details (Category, Price)
- Used VLOOKUP lookup functions to fetch data dynamically:
